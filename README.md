# We have already deploy our project on cloud server,please visit this link:https://comp3820.azurewebsites.net/

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Our project is to obtain data in FHIR format through the Smart system, and establish a connection with GenHealth's API for predicting the patient's future condition through the parsed patient data. We generate the patient's clinical medical advice through GenHealth's API and directly push the patient's clinical medical advice to the front end. Let the doctor choose whether to save the current clinical medical advice for this patient. <br>
Our project: https://comp3820.azurewebsites.net/

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

1. Open [Smart launcher](https://launch.smarthealthit.org/) 

2. Select the Launcher type as BackEnd Service, like the picture below, and going into Client Registration & Validation page to config your own client ID and Scope(the only allowed scope is system/*.read) like the second picture.
3. Copy the Server's FHIR Base URL in the second image

<p>

### Go to the backend resource folder
```
cd backend/back-end-project/src/main/resources/ 
```

### Config the application file
 By replacing the FHIRUrl with the new Server's FHIR Base URL and replace this mongidb with your production url<br>
you can use our test database with this original url
```
vim application.yml
```
```
server:
  port: 18000
logging:
  file:
    name: temp/genhealthApi.log
  level:
    root: info
    org:
      springframework:
        web: debug
spring:
  data:
    mongodb:
      uri: "mongodb+srv://comp3820:mFAR7f6UGzXFZUK0@cluster0.m5swobe.mongodb.net/comp3820?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
      # <ues your new mongodb url here or ues our test cloud database url>



FHIRUrl: "<your new Server's FHIR Base URL>"
DATACOUNT : 3000

```

### Running back end

#### environment : Java 8
<br>
go to back end folder

```
cd backend/back-end-project/
```

runnign mvn cleam
```

```

runnng mvn package

```
mvn package
```

go to target folder
```
cd target
```

```
 java -jar back-end-project-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 
```


### Running for front end

go to front end folder
```
cd frontend/
```

install
```
npm install
```

run

```
npm start
```


## üöÄ Deployment(Use Docker Compose) <a name = "deployment"></a>



1. go to front end folder


```
cd frontend/
```

2. running build command
```
npm run build
```
3. use the new build floder to replace the build in comp3802BuildFolder

4. use the new jar file in backend/back-end-project/target/back-end-project-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar  to replace the old one in comp3802BuildFolder

5. go to the comp3802BuildFolder
```
cd comp3802BuildFolder/
```
6. run docker compose
```
docker compose up -d
```
